# pad
A SoLiD app for shared collaborate editing of a very simple text document

With a tip of the hat to the long history of the etherpad series of tools.  


You have to check it out into some SoliD storage and it will be a shared collaborative notepad … though it won’t run in githib.io because it doesn’t allow write.

Files are at

https://timbl.github.io/pad

but do not run there as github.io is read-only.
